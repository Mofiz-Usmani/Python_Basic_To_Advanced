OOPS in Python (Object-Oriented Programming System)


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach
that organizes code using classes and objects.


OOP is used to structure programs in a clear and organized way
by grouping related data and behavior together using classes
and objects.


In Python, OOP helps to:
- Write clean and reusable code
- Model real-world entities
- Improve scalability and maintainability


Why OOP is used in Python:
- Makes code easier to understand and manage
- Helps reuse code instead of writing it again
- Simplifies large and complex programs
- Improves maintainability and scalability
- Represents real-world entities in code


Python supports OOP naturally and is widely used in
web development, software applications, games, and AI systems.


Core concepts of OOP in Python:
1. Class       → Blueprint of an object
2. Object      → Instance of a class
3. Encapsulation → Binding data and methods together
4. Inheritance → Reusing code from parent classes
5. Polymorphism → Same method, different behavior
6. Abstraction → Hiding implementation details


This file contains basic examples of OOP concepts in Python
for learning and practice purposes.
